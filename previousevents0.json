The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/spacestation_images/international2520space2520station_image_20190220215716.jpeg"}],"program":[{"id":11,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/11/?format=json","name":"Commercial Resupply Services","description":"Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) are a series of flights awarded by NASA for the delivery of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station.The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for twelve cargo Dragon and $1.9 billion to Orbital Sciences for eight Cygnus flights, covering deliveries to 2016.

Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998, with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000. It has been inhabited continuously since that date. The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998, with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000. It has been inhabited continuously since that date. The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998, with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000. It has been inhabited continuously since that date. The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/spacestation_images/international2520space2520station_image_20190220215716.jpeg"}],"program":[{"id":11,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/11/?format=json","name":"Commercial Resupply Services","description":"Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) are a series of flights awarded by NASA for the delivery of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station.The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for twelve cargo Dragon and $1.9 billion to Orbital Sciences for eight Cygnus flights, covering deliveries to 2016.

DART's primary objective is to demonstrate a kinetic impact on a small asteroid.  The binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos is the target for DART.   While Didymos' primary body is approximately 800 meters across, its secondary body has a 150-meter size, which is more typical of the size of asteroids that could pose a more common hazard to Earth.\r\n\r\nThe DART spacecraft will achieve the kinetic impact by deliberately crashing itself into the moonlet at a speed of approximately 6 km/s, with the aid of an onboard camera and sophisticated autonomous navigation software. The collision will change the speed of the moonlet in its orbit around the main body by a fraction of one percent, enough to be measured using telescopes on Earth.","launch_designator":null,"type":"Robotic Exploration","orbit":{"id":6,"name":"Heliocentric N/A","abbrev":"Helio-N/A"}},"pad":{"id":16,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/16/?format=json","agency_id":null,"name":"Space Launch Complex 4E","info_url":null,"wiki_url":"","map_url":"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.632+N,+120.611+W","latitude":"34.632","longitude":"-120.611","location":{"id":11,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/11/?format=json","name":"Vandenberg SFB, CA, USA","country_code":"USA","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg","total_launch_count":699,"total_landing_count":6},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg","total_launch_count":93},"webcast_live":true,"image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/falcon2520925_image_20211123182921.jpeg","infographic":null,"program":[]}],"expeditions":[],"spacestations":[],"program":[]},{"id":281,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/event/281/?format=json","slug":"progress-ms-18-docking","name":"Progress MS-18 Docking","updates":[],"type":{"id":2,"name":"Docking"},"description":"The Progress MS-18 spacecraft is scheduled to autonomously dock to the Zvezda module of the ISS.","webcast_live":true,"location":"International Space Station","news_url":null,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg","feature_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/event_images/progress_ms-18__image_20210519113259.jpg","date":"2021-10-30T01:33:30Z","launches":[{"id":"5175abf5-6cac-4b57-ae16-edabc138966a","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/5175abf5-6cac-4b57-ae16-edabc138966a/?format=json","slug":"soyuz-21a-progress-ms-18-79p","name":"Soyuz 2.1a | Progress MS-18 (79P)","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful","abbrev":"Success","description":"The launch vehicle successfully inserted its payload(s) into the target orbit(s)."},"last_updated":"2021-10-30T23:56:10Z","net":"2021-10-28T00:00:32Z","window_end":"2021-10-28T00:00:32Z","window_start":"2021-10-28T00:00:32Z","probability":null,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"rocket":{"id":2888,"configuration":{"id":24,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/24/?format=json","name":"Soyuz 2.1a","family":"Soyuz","full_name":"Soyuz 2.1a","variant":""}},"mission":{"id":1304,"name":"Progress MS-18 (79P)","description":"The Progress MS-18 spacecraft will resupply the International Space Station.","launch_designator":null,"type":"Resupply","orbit":{"id":8,"name":"Low Earth Orbit","abbrev":"LEO"}},"pad":{"id":20,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/20/?format=json","agency_id":null,"name":"31/6","info_url":null,"wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome_Site_31","map_url":"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.996+N,+63.564+E","latitude":"45.996034","longitude":"63.564003","location":{"id":15,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/15/?format=json","name":"Baikonur Cosmodrome, Republic of Kazakhstan","country_code":"KAZ","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_15_20200803142517.jpg","total_launch_count":1532,"total_landing_count":0},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_20_20200803143516.jpg","total_launch_count":402},"webcast_live":true,"image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz_2.1a_image_20201013143850.jpg","infographic":null,"program":[{"id":17,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/17/?format=json","name":"International Space Station","description":"The International Space Station programme is tied together by a complex set of legal, political and financial agreements between the sixteen nations involved in the project, governing ownership of the various components, rights to crewing and utilization, and responsibilities for crew rotation and resupply of the International Space Station.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/spacestation_images/international2520space2520station_image_20190220215716.jpeg"}],"program":[{"id":17,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/17/?format=json","name":"International Space Station","description":"The International Space Station programme is tied together by a complex set of legal, political and financial agreements between the sixteen nations involved in the project, governing ownership of the various components, rights to crewing and utilization, and responsibilities for crew rotation and resupply of the International Space Station.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth.

Ingenuity was commanded to climb to an altitude of 33 feet (10 meters) before translating 492 feet (150 meters) to the southwest at a ground speed of 9 mph (4 meters per second). At that point, it was to translate 49 feet (15 meters) to the south while taking images toward the west, then fly another 164 feet (50 meters) northeast and land.\r\n\r\nTelemetry from Flight Six shows that the first 150-meter leg of the flight went off without a hitch. But toward the end of that leg, something happened: Ingenuity began adjusting its velocity and tilting back and forth in an oscillating pattern. This behavior persisted throughout the rest of the flight. Prior to landing safely, onboard sensors indicated the rotorcraft encountered roll and pitch excursions of more than 20 degrees, large control inputs, and spikes in power consumption.\r\n\r\nDespite encountering this anomaly, Ingenuity was able to maintain flight and land safely on the surface within approximately 16 feet (5 meters) of the intended landing location.","webcast_live":false,"location":"Airfield B, Jezero crater, Mars","news_url":"https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/302/plans-underway-for-ingenuitys-sixth-flight/","video_url":null,"feature_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/event_images/nasa_mars_2020__image_20210520051302.jpeg","date":"2021-05-27T19:26:00Z","launches":[{"id":"c4db6995-f25f-4608-8eb9-ce95d5226af2","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/c4db6995-f25f-4608-8eb9-ce95d5226af2/?format=json","slug":"atlas-v-541-mars-2020-perseverance-rover-ingenuity","name":"Atlas V 541 | Mars 2020 (Perseverance rover & Ingenuity helicopter)","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful","abbrev":"Success","description":"The launch vehicle successfully inserted its payload(s) into the target orbit(s)."},"last_updated":"2022-02-03T22:09:33Z","net":"2020-07-30T11:50:00Z","window_end":"2020-07-30T13:50:00Z","window_start":"2020-07-30T11:50:00Z","probability":90,"holdreason":null,"failreason":null,"hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":124,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/124/?format=json","name":"United Launch Alliance","type":"Commercial"},"rocket":{"id":157,"configuration":{"id":1,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/1/?format=json","name":"Atlas V 541","family":"Atlas","full_name":"Atlas V 541","variant":"541"}},"mission":{"id":1126,"name":"Mars 2020 (Perseverance rover & Ingenuity helicopter)","description":"Atop this ULA Atlas V rocket will be Perseverance, a car-sized rover which will explore an ancient river delta on Mars.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth.

Later this year, the new solar arrays will be positioned in front of six of the current arrays, increasing the station’s total available power from 160 kilowatts to up to 215 kilowatts. Rubins will be extravehicular crew member 1 (EV 1) wearing red stripes. Glover will be extravehicular crew member 2 (EV 2) and wear a suit with no stripes.","webcast_live":true,"location":"International Space Station","news_url":"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-tv-coverage-scheduled-for-upcoming-spacewalks-briefing","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcv6beMn750","feature_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/event_images/us_eva-71_image_20210105202023.jpg","date":"2021-02-28T11:00:00Z","launches":[],"expeditions":[{"id":140,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/expedition/140/?format=json","name":"Expedition 64","start":"2020-10-20T20:15:00Z","end":"2021-04-17T01:34:00Z","spacestation":{"id":4,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/spacestation/4/?format=json","name":"International Space Station","status":{"id":1,"name":"Active"},"orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/spacestation_images/international2520space2520station_image_20190220215716.jpeg"},"mission_patches":[]}],"spacestations":[{"id":4,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/spacestation/4/?format=json","name":"International Space Station","status":{"id":1,"name":"Active"},"founded":"1998-11-20","description":"The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998, with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000. It has been inhabited continuously since that date. The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/spacestation_images/international2520space2520station_image_20190220215716.jpeg"}],"program":[{"id":17,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/17/?format=json","name":"International Space Station","description":"The International Space Station programme is tied together by a complex set of legal, political and financial agreements between the sixteen nations involved in the project, governing ownership of the various components, rights to crewing and utilization, and responsibilities for crew rotation and resupply of the International Space Station.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The chosen landing area is Utopia Planitia, a huge basin formed by a large impact far back in Mars' history. The rover is expected to be in operation for about 90 Martian sols. The Tianwen-1 orbiter will provide a relay communication link to the rover while performing its own scientific observations for one Martian year.\n\nThe orbiter will operate in a polar orbit in order to  map Mars' morphology and geological structure while also using the Mars-Orbiting Subsurface Exploration Radar instrument to investigate soil characteristics and water-ice distribution. It will also measure the ionosphere and the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, the new paper reported. The rover will have 13 instruments detecting things such as topography, soil, environment, atmosphere, water ice, physical field and internal structure. It will investigate the surface soil characteristics and water-ice distribution with its own Subsurface Exploration Radar.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth.

Its mission is devoted to ensure an even coverage of the areas of national interest, providing a large operational capability in the capture of high-resolution multi-spectral land optical images for numerous user groups, as well as supporting and optimizing the development in Spain of teledetection-based applications in Spain. The overall mission objective is to provide information for applications in cartography, land use, urban management, water management, environmental monitoring, risk management and security.\r\n\r\nTARANIS (Tool for the Analysis of RAdiation from lightNIngand Sprites), the Celtic god of thunder and lightning, is the first satellite designed to observe luminous, radiative and electromagnetic phenomena occurring at altitudes of 20 to 100 km over thunderstorms. Discovered 20 years ago, such transient luminous events (TLEs) such as red sprites, blue jets, elves, sprite halos, etc. remain shrouded in mystery. They are sometimes accompanied by terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). The TARANIS microsatellite will fly over thousands of TLEs and TGFs for at least four years and will be capable of detecting these events and recording their luminous and radiative signatures at high resolution, as well as the electromagnetic perturbations they set off in Earth’s upper atmosphere. The payload includes numerous sensors to observe the TLEs and to perform in-situ measurements of perturbations caused on the local plasma (fields, waves and particles).","launch_designator":null,"type":"Earth Science","orbit":{"id":17,"name":"Sun-Synchronous Orbit","abbrev":"SSO"}},"pad":{"id":34,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/34/?format=json","agency_id":115,"name":"Ariane Launch Area 1","info_url":null,"wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELA-1","map_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/?q=5.239,-52.775","latitude":"5.236","longitude":"-52.775","location":{"id":13,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/13/?format=json","name":"Kourou, French Guiana","country_code":"GUF","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_13_20200803142412.jpg","total_launch_count":314,"total_landing_count":0},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_34_20200803143527.jpg","total_launch_count":47},"webcast_live":true,"image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/vega_image_20201111143622.jpeg","infographic":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/vega2520257c_infographic_20201116161633.png","program":[]}],"expeditions":[],"spacestations":[],"program":[]},{"id":186,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/event/186/?format=json","slug":"spacex-crew-1-resilience-crew-dragon-hatch-opening","name":"SpaceX Crew-1 \"Resilience\" Crew Dragon Hatch Opening","updates":[],"type":{"id":12,"name":"Hatch Opening"},"description":"The \"Resilience\" Crew Dragon hatch will be opened, allowing JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi and NASA astronauts Victor J.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

The mission's main goal is to obtain a sample of at least 60 grams from 101955 Bennu, a carbonaceous near-Earth asteroid, and return the sample to Earth for a detailed analysis.\r\n\r\nRehearsals will be performed before the sampling event, during which the solar arrays will be raised into a Y-shaped configuration to minimize the chance of dust accumulation during contact and provide more ground clearance in case the spacecraft tips over (up to 45°) during contact. The descent will be very slow to minimize thruster firings prior to contact in order to reduce the likelihood of asteroid surface contamination by unreacted hydrazine propellant. Contact with the surface of Bennu will be detected using accelerometers, and the impact force will be dissipated by a spring in the TAGSAM arm.\r\n\r\nUpon surface contact by the TAGSAM instrument, a burst of nitrogen gas will be released, which will blow regolith particles smaller than 2 cm (0.8 in) into the sampler head at the end of the robotic arm. A five-second timer will limit collection time to mitigate the chance of a collision. After the timer expires, the back-away maneuver will initiate a safe departure from the asteroid.","webcast_live":false,"location":"101955 Bennu","news_url":"https://www.nasa.gov/osiris-rex","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6K2dqCoin8","feature_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/event_images/osiris-rex2520sample2520collection_image_20190729035954.jpg","date":"2020-10-20T21:00:00Z","launches":[],"expeditions":[],"spacestations":[],"program":[]},{"id":172,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/event/172/?format=json","slug":"iss-expedition-63-64-change-of-command-ceremony","name":"ISS Expedition 63-64 Change of Command Ceremony","updates":[],"type":{"id":15,"name":"Change of Command"},"description":"NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, Expedition 63 commander, will hand over the International Space Station command to ROSCOSMOS cosmonaut Sergey Ryzhikov who will become commander of Expedition 64.","webcast_live":false,"location":"International Space Station","news_url":null,"video_url":"https://youtu.be/21X5lGlDOfg","feature_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/event_images/iss_expedition__image_20200910091053.jpeg","date":"2020-10-20T20:15:00Z","launches":[{"id":"79e3f7a7-9c50-4d87-a069-c6aa7dd641d6","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/79e3f7a7-9c50-4d87-a069-c6aa7dd641d6/?format=json","slug":"soyuz-21a-soyuz-ms-17","name":"Soyuz 2.1a | Soyuz MS-17","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful","abbrev":"Success","description":"The launch vehicle successfully inserted its payload(s) into the target orbit(s)."},"last_updated":"2020-11-04T00:06:50Z","net":"2020-10-14T05:45:04Z","window_end":"2020-10-14T05:45:04Z","window_start":"2020-10-14T05:45:04Z","probability":-1,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"rocket":{"id":2203,"configuration":{"id":24,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/24/?format=json","name":"Soyuz 2.1a","family":"Soyuz","full_name":"Soyuz 2.1a","variant":""}},"mission":{"id":1193,"name":"Soyuz MS-17","description":"Soyuz MS-17 begins expedition 63 by carrying Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and NASA astronaut Kathleen Rubins to the International Space Station aboard the Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998, with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000. It has been inhabited continuously since that date. The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/spacestation_images/international2520space2520station_image_20190220215716.jpeg"}],"program":[{"id":11,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/11/?format=json","name":"Commercial Resupply Services","description":"Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) are a series of flights awarded by NASA for the delivery of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station.The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for twelve cargo Dragon and $1.9 billion to Orbital Sciences for eight Cygnus flights, covering deliveries to 2016.

It will carry NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to the International Space Station for an extended stay (the specific mission duration will be determined once on station based on the readiness of the next commercial crew launch). They will perform tests on Crew Dragon in addition to conducting research and other tasks with the space station crew. \n\nAs the final flight test for SpaceX, this mission will validate the company’s crew transportation system, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities. This also will be the first time NASA astronauts will test the spacecraft systems in orbit. The Demo-2 mission will be the final major step before NASA’s Commercial Crew Program certifies Crew Dragon for operational, long-duration missions to the space station.\n\nCurrent Mission Status:\nAfter a successful ride to orbit and stay at the International Space Station, the Dragon Spacecraft successfully made its way back to Earth.

They will perform tests on Crew Dragon in addition to conducting research and other tasks with the space station crew. \n\nAs the final flight test for SpaceX, this mission will validate the company’s crew transportation system, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities. This also will be the first time NASA astronauts will test the spacecraft systems in orbit. The Demo-2 mission will be the final major step before NASA’s Commercial Crew Program certifies Crew Dragon for operational, long-duration missions to the space station.\n\nCurrent Mission Status:\nAfter a successful ride to orbit and stay at the International Space Station, the Dragon Spacecraft successfully made its way back to Earth.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface.","webcast_live":false,"location":"Lunar Surface","news_url":"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/apollo-11-in-real-time-50-years-later/","video_url":"https://apolloinrealtime.org/11/","feature_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/event_images/apollo252011th2520-2520lunar2520landing252050th2520anniversary_image_20190715211113.jpg","date":"2019-07-20T20:17:00Z","launches":[{"id":"aed29ce0-d4e3-4177-b286-d186c7b21354","url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/aed29ce0-d4e3-4177-b286-d186c7b21354/?format=json","slug":"saturn-v-apollo-11","name":"Saturn V | Apollo 11","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful","abbrev":"Success","description":"The launch vehicle successfully inserted its payload(s) into the target orbit(s)."},"last_updated":"2022-02-03T22:10:22Z","net":"1969-07-16T13:32:00Z","window_end":"1969-07-16T13:32:00Z","window_start":"1969-07-16T13:32:00Z","probability":-1,"holdreason":null,"failreason":null,"hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"rocket":{"id":222,"configuration":{"id":93,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/93/?format=json","name":"Saturn V","family":"Saturn","full_name":"Saturn V","variant":"V"}},"mission":{"id":155,"name":"Apollo 11","description":"Apollo 11 was commanded by Neil Armstrong , Command Module Pilot Michael Collins and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\" E.
