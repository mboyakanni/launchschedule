Originally Tim Kopra was scheduled to fly on STS-133, but Kopra had a bicycle injury shortly before the mission, and so he was replaced by Bowen.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/stephen2520bowen_image_20181203170035.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/62/79/6279a01f3347301e7a7c9e39bb277cc1.jpg","agency":{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"2895738c-a7e0-421d-b0d8-86d347e899f3","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520endeavour2520ov-101_image_20190222030547.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Endeavour / OV-105 | STS-126","net":"2008-11-15T00:55:00Z"},{"id":"c4b6b5fa-4ab0-47b8-9db3-97761834d7b1","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520atlantis2520ov-104_image_20190222030553.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Atlantis / OV-104 | STS-132","net":"2010-05-14T18:20:00Z"},{"id":"95875b04-a488-4791-b54f-35615c3223d6","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520discovery2520ov-103_image_20190222030538.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Discovery / OV-103 | STS-133","net":"2011-02-24T21:53:24Z"}],"last_flight":"2011-02-24T21:53:24Z","first_flight":"2008-11-15T00:55:00Z"},{"id":547,"name":"Alvin Drew","nationality":"American","date_of_birth":"1962-11-05","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Colonel Benjamin Alvin Drew is a United States Air Force officer and a NASA astronaut.

Cenker worked for 18 years at RCA Astro-Electronics, and its successor company GE Astro Space, on a variety of spacecraft projects. He spent most of his career working on commercial communications satellites, including the Satcom, Spacenet and GStar programs.\r\n\r\nIn January 1986, Cenker was a crew member on the twenty-fourth mission of NASA's Space Shuttle program, the seventh flight of Space Shuttle Columbia, designated as mission STS-61-C. Cenker served as a Payload Specialist, representing RCA Astro-Electronics. This mission was the final flight before the Challenger disaster, which caused the Space Shuttle program to be suspended until 1988, and impacted NASA's Payload Specialist program for even longer. As a result, Cenker's mission was called \"The End of Innocence\" for the Shuttle program. Following the completion of his Shuttle mission, Cenker returned to work in the commercial aerospace field. Since his flight, he has made numerous public appearances representing NASA and the Shuttle program, in the United States, as well as internationally.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/robert2520j.2520cenker_image_20190211162555.jpeg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/b7/f6/b7f638d2928cde381122050eb02e3889.jpg","agency":{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"bbb4c25a-152d-4402-beee-2f62969b98c1","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520columbia2520ov-102_image_20190222030326.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Columbia / OV-102 | STS-61-C","net":"1986-01-12T11:55:00Z"}],"last_flight":"1986-01-12T11:55:00Z","first_flight":"1986-01-12T11:55:00Z"},{"id":598,"name":"Gregory Jarvis","nationality":"American","date_of_birth":"1944-08-24","date_of_death":"1986-01-28","bio":"Gregory Bruce Jarvis (August 24, 1944 – January 28, 1986) was an American engineer who died during the destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger on mission STS-51-L, where he was serving as Payload Specialist for Hughes Aircraft.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/gregory2520jarvis_image_20181207232730.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/85/36/8536a1e4c2c6eaade0161fbd9e2e1d6d.jpg","agency":{"id":93,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/93/?format=json","name":"Hughes Aircraft","type":"Commercial"},"flights":[{"id":"ca242e45-07c7-404d-962b-ba1795d9166a","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520challenger2520ov-099_image_20190222030147.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Challenger / OV-099 | STS-51-L","net":"1986-01-28T16:38:00Z"}],"last_flight":"1986-01-28T16:38:00Z","first_flight":"1986-01-28T16:38:00Z"},{"id":599,"name":"Christa McAuliffe","nationality":"American","date_of_birth":"1948-09-02","date_of_death":"1986-01-28","bio":"Sharon Christa McAuliffe (born Sharon Christa Corrigan; September 2, 1948 – January 28, 1986) was an American teacher and astronaut from Concord, New Hampshire and one of the seven crew members killed in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/christa2520mcauliffe_image_20181207232919.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/26/07/2607251403437f9e034394c82971300f.jpg","agency":{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"ca242e45-07c7-404d-962b-ba1795d9166a","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520challenger2520ov-099_image_20190222030147.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Challenger / OV-099 | STS-51-L","net":"1986-01-28T16:38:00Z"}],"last_flight":"1986-01-28T16:38:00Z","first_flight":"1986-01-28T16:38:00Z"},{"id":600,"name":"Samuel T.

Along with thirteen other pilots, Chaffee was selected to be an astronaut as part of NASA Astronaut Group 3 in 1963. He served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for the Gemini 3 and Gemini 4 missions and received his first spaceflight assignment in 1966 as the third-ranking pilot on Apollo 1. In 1967, he died in a fire along with fellow astronauts Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom and Ed White during a pre-launch test for the mission at what was then the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34, Florida. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor and a second Air Medal.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/roger_b._chaffe_image_20210509184925.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/80/5b/805b8ee6adeffbd0a1a8fbec414b3b04.jpg","agency":{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"a49d791b-3c7f-4ee9-8917-14596a2a1a25","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/saturn2520ib_image_20190222030046.jpeg","name":"Saturn IB | Apollo 1 (Failure before launch)","net":"1967-02-21T00:00:00Z"}],"last_flight":"1967-02-21T00:00:00Z","first_flight":"1967-02-21T00:00:00Z"},{"id":665,"name":"Deng Qingming","nationality":"Chinese","date_of_birth":"1966-03-16","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Deng Qingming is a Chinese pilot selected as part of the Shenzhou program.
