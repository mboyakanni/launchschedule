Along with it is launched an engineering test satellite SLATS (Super Low Altitude Test Satellite), which is an attempt to develop techniques to operate a satellite in extremely low orbits. SLATS will try achieve that by maintaining position in orbit via ion engines. It will also collect data on atmosphere density and measure atomic oxygen in such low altitudes.","type":"Earth Science"},"pad":{"id":41,"name":"Yoshinobu Launch Complex","location":{"id":26,"name":{"id":26,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/26/?format=json","name":"Tanegashima, Japan","country_code":"JPN","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_26_20200803142507.jpg","total_launch_count":84,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_41_20200803143551.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":0,"title":"H2Aロケット37号機打ち上げ衛星しきさい・つばめ搭載","description":"2017年12月23日(土)、午前10時26分22秒に種子島宇宙センターから、気候変動観測衛星「しきさい」、超低高度衛星技術試験機「つばめ」を搭載したH-2Aロケット37号機の打ち上げを南種子町茎永上里から撮影したものを紹介しています。撮影・作成＝ふるさと種子島","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-KzbdR5qHLM/maxresdefault.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KzbdR5qHLM"},{"priority":0,"title":"H-IIAロケット37号機 打上げ","description":"打上げ予定日(Launch Date）：2017/12/23 (Sat) 打上げ予定時刻(Launch Time)：10:26'22\" to 10:48'22\" +0900(JST) 予備期間（Preliminary duration）：2017/12/24 to 2018/1/31 ペイロード（衛星）Paylo...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cQzpCp80Lo/maxresdefault.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQzpCp80Lo"},{"priority":0,"title":"気候変動観測衛星「しきさい」（GCOM-C）＆超低高度衛星技術試験機「つばめ」（SLATS）打ち上げライブ中継","description":"本日の打ち上げや人工衛星に関する情報は、 地球観測衛星特設サイトをご覧ください！ http://fanfun.jaxa.jp/eos/ The live broadcast of the GCOM-C & SLATS / H-IIA F37 launch Launch Date: Dec. 23, 2017（JS...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-UyZE-LIUA/hqdefault.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-UyZE-LIUA"}],"image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/h-iia2520202_image_20190222031201.jpeg","infographic":null},{"id":"3a5e79d9-67b1-4503-8fb1-8b89608ed845","name":"Soyuz-FG | Soyuz MS-07","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"2017-12-17T07:21:01Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":63,"name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","abbrev":"RFSA","logo_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/logo/russian2520federal2520space2520agency25202528roscosmos2529_logo_20190207032459.png","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/agency_images/russian2520federal2520space2520agency25202528roscosmos2529_image_20190207032459.jpeg","nation_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/agency_nation/russian2520federal2520space2520agency25202528roscosmos2529_nation_20190207032459.png"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":34,"name":"Soyuz","family":"Soyuz-U","full_name":"Soyuz FG"},"spacecraft_stage":{"launch_crew":[{"id":1019,"role":{"id":1,"role":"Commander"},"astronaut":{"id":252,"name":"Anton Shkaplerov","status":{"id":1,"name":"Active"},"date_of_birth":"1972-02-20","date_of_death":null,"nationality":"Russian"}},{"id":1022,"role":{"id":3,"role":"Flight Engineer"},"astronaut":{"id":566,"name":"Scott D.
