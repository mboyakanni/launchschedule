The scientific program for the flight was prepared entirely by Bulgarian scientists, along with some of the equipment.\r\n\r\nThough take-off was smooth, the mission was a disaster, with severe damage of the engine preventing docking in orbit to Salyut 6 orbital station as it was initially planned. A premature return to Earth became the only possible decision for Ivanov and Rukavishnikov. Due to some additional technical problems landing was difficult to endure-more than 9Gs. When Soyuz 33 finally landed, it was 320 kilometres (200 mi) southeast of Dzhezkazgan. It completed 31 orbits, and was in space for 1 day, 23 hours, and 1 minute. The flight remains the only example for manual landing and is thus quoted in every astronautic textbook.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/georgi2520ivanov_image_20181129231428.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/aa/af/aaafd7091049621fa1127d66d7809b7f.jpg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"c587ed55-76e7-4e59-9a33-25bb5f21cbf8","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz2520u_image_20190222031023.jpeg","name":"Soyuz-U | Soyuz 33","net":"1979-04-10T17:34:34Z"}],"last_flight":"1979-04-10T17:34:34Z","first_flight":"1979-04-10T17:34:34Z"},{"id":156,"name":"Sigmund Jähn","nationality":"German","date_of_birth":"1937-02-13","date_of_death":"2019-09-21","bio":"Sigmund Werner Paul Jähn (born 13 February 1937) is a German cosmonaut and pilot, who in 1978 became the first German to fly in space as part of the Soviet Union's Interkosmos programme.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/sigmund2520j25c325a4hn_image_20181129231552.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/1f/c2/1fc252af11c8c5a6b67a321db1f5d73b.jpg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"ebd27066-16ca-4039-ac18-858aa79201e6","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz2520u_image_20190222031023.jpeg","name":"Soyuz-U | Soyuz 31","net":"1978-08-26T14:51:30Z"}],"last_flight":"1978-08-26T14:51:30Z","first_flight":"1978-08-26T14:51:30Z"},{"id":157,"name":"Jing Haipeng","nationality":"Chinese","date_of_birth":"1966-10-24","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Jing Haipeng (simplified Chinese: 景海鹏; traditional Chinese: 景海鵬; pinyin: Jǐng Hǎipéng; born October 24, 1966) is a Chinese pilot and astronaut selected as part of the Shenzhou program.

He has undertaken two further long-duration stays aboard the ISS, as a crew member of Expedition 24 / 25. For this mission he was launched with the spacecraft Soyuz TMA-19, and he landed in November 2010, also with the TMA-19 spacecraft. He served as Soyuz Commander for his fourth mission aboard Soyuz TMA-09M, as Flight Engineer for Expedition 36 and ISS Commander for Expedition 37. In April 2017, Yurchikhin launched on Soyuz MS-04 for the fifth spaceflight of his career, a six-month mission to the ISS as part of Expedition 51 and 52, for which he was the Commander.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/fyodor2520yurchikhin_image_20181201232049.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/4b/d9/4bd96f56217749928f80a131685f937a.jpg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"763dcd6e-c3e1-46d9-9fa9-6edc2076c107","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520atlantis2520ov-104_image_20190222030553.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Atlantis / OV-104 | STS-112","net":"2002-10-07T19:45:51Z"},{"id":"c1c61e73-93d9-45a2-a4c5-2b1642e9820e","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz_image_20190717035537.jpg","name":"Soyuz-FG | Soyuz TMA-10","net":"2007-04-07T17:31:09Z"},{"id":"a6a16302-e901-4677-aed7-03cc354e70c2","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz_image_20190717035537.jpg","name":"Soyuz FG | Soyuz TMA-19","net":"2010-06-15T21:35:00Z"},{"id":"be714c91-b0dc-40f2-a185-0a0a8551ace8","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz_image_20190717035537.jpg","name":"Soyuz FG | Soyuz TMA-09M","net":"2013-05-28T20:31:24Z"},{"id":"be9c521e-dba1-423d-9d78-b4d45f483785","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz_image_20190717035537.jpg","name":"Soyuz-FG | Soyuz MS-04","net":"2017-04-20T07:13:45Z"}],"last_flight":"2017-04-20T07:13:45Z","first_flight":"2002-10-07T19:45:51Z"},{"id":295,"name":"Sergei Zalyotin","nationality":"Russian","date_of_birth":"1962-04-21","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Sergei Viktorovich Zalyotin is a Russian cosmonaut and a veteran of two space missions.\r\n\r\nZalyotin was born in Tula and attended the Borisoglebsk Higher Military School before becoming a fighter pilot in the Russian Air Force.

Peterson was originally selected for the Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program, but, when that was canceled, he became a NASA astronaut in September 1969. He was a mission specialist on STS-6 on board Challenger. During the mission Peterson performed a spacewalk to test the new airlock and space suits. He logged 120 hours in space. Peterson retired from NASA in 1984.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/donald2520h.2520peterson_image_20181202094041.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/3b/b4/3bb434796804a0f49f72b4ffd0bf10a6.jpg","agency":{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"cb5402bd-5432-42f2-9f5b-961cb3b3b838","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520challenger2520ov-099_image_20190222030147.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Challenger / OV-099 | STS-6","net":"1983-04-04T18:30:00Z"}],"last_flight":"1983-04-04T18:30:00Z","first_flight":"1983-04-04T18:30:00Z"},{"id":332,"name":"Richard H.

In addition to holding some technical assignments, he logged more than 700 hours in space (including stints on the Columbia, the Atlantis and the Endeavour), before he left NASA in 1996 to pursue a career in the private sector.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/g.2520david2520low_image_20181202134532.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/24/5f/245f4d6356cb471f69466b49b7494174.jpg","agency":{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"59271dfc-e41d-4d98-a4f0-1e737d8711f9","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520columbia2520ov-102_image_20190222030326.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Columbia / OV-102 | STS-32","net":"1990-01-09T12:35:00Z"},{"id":"881b11ee-d629-4d89-b936-df7e2202ef9a","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520atlantis2520ov-104_image_20190222030553.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Atlantis / OV-104 | STS-43","net":"1991-08-02T15:01:59Z"},{"id":"21a8c666-b595-4472-9b1b-a7d76f9340f8","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520endeavour2520ov-101_image_20190222030547.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Endeavour / OV-105 | STS-57","net":"1993-06-21T13:07:00Z"}],"last_flight":"1993-06-21T13:07:00Z","first_flight":"1990-01-09T12:35:00Z"},{"id":394,"name":"William Shepherd","nationality":"American","date_of_birth":"1949-07-26","date_of_death":null,"bio":"William McMichael \"Bill\" Shepherd is an American former Navy SEAL, aerospace, ocean, and mechanical engineer, and NASA astronaut who served as Commander of Expedition 1, the first crew on the International Space Station.
