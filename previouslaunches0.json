It will feature an X-band synthetic aperture radar.\r\n\r\nStriX β is an upgraded version of the StriX α prototype. The satellite features two deployable panes, one side carrying solar cells, the other carrying the X-band radar antenna.\r\n\r\nThe StriX satellite constellation can target data with a ground resolution of 1-3 m, single polarized (VV), and a swath width of more than 10-30 km. The StriX observation modes are Stripmap and Sliding Spotlight mode and each satellite has an SAR antenna that is 5 meters in length and stowed during launch. The simple design of the satellites allows for affordable development of the constellation.\r\n\r\nStriX β was planned to be launched in 2021 on a Soyuz-2-1a Fregat or Soyuz-2-1b Fregat rideshare mission, but as this mission was delayed, it was re-booked on a dedicated Electron KS launch.\r\n\r\nSynspective is planning a constellation of 25 satellites called StriX, comprised of 100-kilogram satellites capable of imaging at a resolution of one to three meters. By 2022 the company plans to have six satellites in orbit. The company has not set a date by which it hopes to achieve 25 satellites.","type":"Earth Science"},"pad":{"id":185,"name":"Rocket Lab Launch Complex

It consists of a dual mission to augment both L-band and Ka-band Global Xpress services.\r\n\r\nAirbus Defence and Space has been awarded a contract by Inmarsat to design and develop the first two Inmarsat-6 (I-6) mobile communications satellites, creating the most versatile mobile services satellites in its fleet.\r\n\r\nThe two I-6 satellites are based on Airbus Defence and Space's Eurostar platform in its E3000e variant, which exclusively uses electric propulsion for orbit raising. The satellites take advantage of the reduction in mass that this electric propulsion technology enables for a dual payload mission, with an exceptionally large next generation digitally processed payload.\r\n\r\nI-6 F1 and F2 both carry a large 9 m aperture L-band antenna and nine multibeam Ka-band antennas, and feature a high level of flexibility and connectivity. A new generation modular digital processor provides full routing flexibility over up to 8000 channels and dynamic power allocation to over 200 spot beams in L-band. Ka-band spot beams are steerable over the full Earth disk, with flexible channel to beam allocation.","type":"Communications"},"pad":{"id":41,"name":"Yoshinobu Launch Complex","location":{"id":26,"name":{"id":26,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/26/?format=json","name":"Tanegashima, Japan","country_code":"JPN","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_26_20200803142507.jpg","total_launch_count":84,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_41_20200803143551.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":9,"title":"Live streaming for the launch of H-IIA F45 with I-6 F1/ H-IIAロケット45号機による通信衛星Inmarsat-6 F1 打上げライブ中継","description":"Watch Live streaming for the launch of H-IIA Launch Vehicle No. 45.Inmarsat-6 F1, the first satellite in Inmarsat's sixth series of satellites, Inmarsat-6, i...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-46i9KT83wM/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-46i9KT83wM"},{"priority":10,"title":"Inmarsat-6 F1 launch","description":"Tune in to watch the launch of I-6 F1 from the JAXA Tanegashima Space Centre in Japan with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3aBfB8NdEQ/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3aBfB8NdEQ"}],"image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/h-iia_image_20190222031043.jpeg","infographic":null},{"id":"878ba32c-5e93-4d2b-95c3-24b60c8b05e7","name":"Falcon 9 Block 5 | Dragon CRS-2 SpX-24","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"2021-12-21T10:07:08Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":121,"name":"SpaceX","abbrev":"SpX","logo_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/logo/spacex_logo_20191121063502.png","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/agency_images/spacex_image_20190207032501.jpeg","nation_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/agency_nation/spacex_nation_20190207032501.jpeg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":164,"name":"Falcon 9","family":"Falcon","full_name":"Falcon 9 Block 5"},"spacecraft_stage":{"launch_crew":[]}},"mission":{"id":1306,"name":"Dragon CRS-2 SpX-24","description":"24th commercial resupply services mission to the International Space Station operated by SpaceX.

The satellites span a range of operations, from TriSept’s tech demonstration of new tether systems designed to accelerate spacecraft reentry and reduce orbital debris, through to the next generation of maritime surveillance satellites for Unseenlabs, as well as communications satellites for Swarm. The mission will also deploy New Zealand’s first student-built satellite, the APSS-1 satellite for Te Pūnaha Ātea - Auckland Space Institute at The University of Auckland.\r\n\r\nThe DRAGRACER mission will test the effectiveness of new tether technologies designed to accelerate spacecraft reentry and reduce orbital debris at the conclusion of space missions. TriSept has completed the integration of a pair of qualified Millennium Space Systems 6U small satellites, one featuring the tether drag device and one without. The controlled spacecraft should deorbit in approximately 45 days, while the second spacecraft is expected to remain in orbit for seven to nine years.\r\n\r\nBRO-2 and BRO-3 are the second and third satellites in French company Unseenlabs’ planned constellation of about 20 satellites dedicated to maritime surveillance. \r\n\r\nSwarm will launch the latest 24 1/4U SpaceBEE satellites to continue building out its planned constellation of 150 satellites to provide affordable satellite communications services to IoT devices in remote regions around the world. \r\n\r\nThe student-built Waka Āmiorangi Aotearoa APSS-1 satellite is designed to monitor electrical activity in Earth’s upper atmosphere to test whether ionospheric disturbances can predict earthquakes.\r\n\r\nExtra payload on this flight is a 150 mm 3D printed Half-Life Gnome Chompski. Created for Valve Software's co-founder Gabe Newell by design studio Weta Workshop, it serves as an homage to the innovation and creativity of gamers worldwide, and also aims to test and qualify a novel 3D printing technique that could be employed for future spacecraft components. Gnome will remain attached to the Kick Stage and will burn up on reentry.\r\n\r\nBesides payloads, this flight will also serve as a test of Electron's reusability. Rocket Lab will attempt to bring Electron’s first stage back to Earth under a parachute system for a controlled water landing before collection by a recovery vessel.","type":"Dedicated Rideshare"},"pad":{"id":65,"name":"Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1A","location":{"id":10,"name":{"id":10,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/10/?format=json","name":"Onenui Station, Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand","country_code":"NZL","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_10_20200803142509.jpg","total_launch_count":28,"total_landing_count":4}},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_65_20200803143549.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":10,"title":"Rocket Lab 'Return To Sender' Launch","description":"Enjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube.","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZGI_lHGltA/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGI_lHGltA"}],"image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/electron25202_image_20201120015105.jpg","infographic":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/electron25202_infographic_20201112150118.png"},{"id":"d9486816-bb61-4b16-bcfa-0d1e9ba40696","name":"Vega | SEOSAT-Ingenio & Taranis","status":{"id":4,"name":"Launch Failure"},"net":"2020-11-17T01:52:20Z","hashtag":"#SEOSATIngenio","launch_service_provider":{"id":115,"name":"Arianespace","abbrev":"ASA","logo_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/logo/arianespace_logo_20210603173752.png","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/agency_images/arianespace_image_20190207032425.jpeg","nation_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/agency_nation/arianespace_nation_20190207032425.jpeg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":167,"name":"Vega","family":"Vega","full_name":"Vega"}},"mission":{"id":693,"name":"SEOSAT-Ingenio & Taranis","description":"SEOSAT-Ingenio is a high-resolution optical imaging mission of Spain - the flagship mission of the Spanish space strategic plan.

The overall mission objective is to provide information for applications in cartography, land use, urban management, water management, environmental monitoring, risk management and security.\r\n\r\nTARANIS (Tool for the Analysis of RAdiation from lightNIngand Sprites), the Celtic god of thunder and lightning, is the first satellite designed to observe luminous, radiative and electromagnetic phenomena occurring at altitudes of 20 to 100 km over thunderstorms. Discovered 20 years ago, such transient luminous events (TLEs) such as red sprites, blue jets, elves, sprite halos, etc. remain shrouded in mystery. They are sometimes accompanied by terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). The TARANIS microsatellite will fly over thousands of TLEs and TGFs for at least four years and will be capable of detecting these events and recording their luminous and radiative signatures at high resolution, as well as the electromagnetic perturbations they set off in Earth’s upper atmosphere. The payload includes numerous sensors to observe the TLEs and to perform in-situ measurements of perturbations caused on the local plasma (fields, waves and particles).","type":"Earth Science"},"pad":{"id":34,"name":"Ariane Launch Area 1","location":{"id":13,"name":{"id":13,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/13/?format=json","name":"Kourou, French Guiana","country_code":"GUF","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_13_20200803142412.jpg","total_launch_count":314,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_34_20200803143527.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":0,"title":"Arianespace Flight VV17 – SEOSAT-Ingenio and Taranis (EN)","description":"Pour la vérsion en Français, cliquez ici: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_ZrZ6T6o0A Para la version en Español, pulsa aqui: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IveCBs-cCTw/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IveCBs-cCTw"},{"priority":1,"title":"Arianespace Vol VV17 - SEOSAT-Ingenio et Taranis (FR)","description":"For the English version, click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IveCBs-cCTw Para la version en Español, pulsa aqui: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvlt...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T_ZrZ6T6o0A/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_ZrZ6T6o0A"},{"priority":2,"title":"Arianespace Vuelo VV17 – SEOSAT-Ingenio y Taranis (ES)","description":"For the English version, click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IveCBs-cCTw Pour la vérsion en Français, cliquez ici: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gvltt4dyZGI/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvltt4dyZGI"}],"image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/vega_image_20201111143622.jpeg","infographic":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/vega2520257c_infographic_20201116161633.png"},{"id":"0ede12be-ac6d-4571-9d0c-b2a85b5cf280","name":"Falcon 9 Block 5 | Crew-1","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"2020-11-16T00:27:17Z","hashtag":"#LaunchAmerica","launch_service_provider":{"id":121,"name":"SpaceX","abbrev":"SpX","logo_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/logo/spacex_logo_20191121063502.png","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/agency_images/spacex_image_20190207032501.jpeg","nation_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/agency_nation/spacex_nation_20190207032501.jpeg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":164,"name":"Falcon 9","family":"Falcon","full_name":"Falcon 9 Block 5"},"spacecraft_stage":{"launch_crew":[{"id":883,"role":{"id":7,"role":"Mission Specialist"},"astronaut":{"id":211,"name":"Soichi Noguchi","status":{"id":1,"name":"Active"},"date_of_birth":"1965-04-15","date_of_death":null,"nationality":"Japanese"}},{"id":3075,"role":{"id":1,"role":"Commander"},"astronaut":{"id":14,"name":"Michael S.

The chosen landing area is Utopia Planitia, a huge basin formed by a large impact far back in Mars' history. The rover is expected to be in operation for about 90 Martian sols. The Tianwen-1 orbiter will provide a relay communication link to the rover while performing its own scientific observations for one Martian year.\n\nThe orbiter will operate in a polar orbit in order to  map Mars' morphology and geological structure while also using the Mars-Orbiting Subsurface Exploration Radar instrument to investigate soil characteristics and water-ice distribution. It will also measure the ionosphere and the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, the new paper reported. The rover will have 13 instruments detecting things such as topography, soil, environment, atmosphere, water ice, physical field and internal structure. It will investigate the surface soil characteristics and water-ice distribution with its own Subsurface Exploration Radar. It will also analyze surface material composition and characteristics of the Martian climate and environment on the surface.","type":"Robotic Exploration"},"pad":{"id":78,"name":"Wenchang","location":{"id":8,"name":{"id":8,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/8/?format=json","name":"Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, People's Republic of China","country_code":"CHN","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_8_20200803142445.jpg","total_launch_count":17,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_78_20200803143548.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":10,"title":"Live: China's inaugurates first Mars exploration mission Tianwen-1 in southern Hainan Province","description":"2020 can be regarded as the year of Mars.

It will provide broadband services to users in Africa and Europe.  The baseline mission of the satellite is to provide 75 Gbps of capacity across a network of 65 spotbeams that together provide quasi-complete coverage of Sub-Saharan Africa. The satellite will address direct-to-user consumer and enterprise broadband services using dishes from approximately 75 cm. It will also be used for community networks connected to Wi-Fi hotspots, mobile phone backhauling and rural connectivity.\r\nEutelsat Konnect is the first to use Thales Alenia Spaceâ€™s all-electric Spacebus NEO platform, developed under the Neosat Partnership Project conducted by the European and French space agencies (ESA and CNES). More robust, more modular, more powerful, more innovative, more flexible, this platform is perfectly adapted to operators' expectations in the evolving telecommunication market, and particlularly well positioned for very demanding VHTS missions. Eutelsat Konnect will allow the in-orbit validation of the complete end-to-end system of the new Spacebus Neo product line, including the fully-electric orbit-raising phase\r\n\r\nGSAT-30 is a telecommunications satellite designed and manufactured  by  ISRO. To be positioned at a longitude  of  83Â° East, it will provide high-quality television, telecommunications and broadcasting services over Indian mainland and Islands. \r\nGSAT-30 is configured on ISROâ€™s enhanced I-3K platform to provide communications services from geostationary orbit in C-and Ku-band for a lifetime greater than 15 years. By operating GSAT-30, ISRO will once again foster the use of space to help bridge the digital divide in the Indian subcontinent as part of its ambitious space program.

It's one out of two satellites to replace the first generation COSMO-SkyMed system.\n\nThis second-generation system, including its ground segment, will set a new performance standard for space-based radar observation systems in terms of precision, image quality and the flexibility of user services. It is a dual (civil/military) system, designed to address the requirements of both commercial and government customers, as well as the scientific community. The COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation satellites are equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), capable of observations under any weather or light conditions, day or night. \n\nThe Characterising Exoplanet Satellite (CHEOPS) is an ESA mission implemented in partnership â€“ in particular with Switzerland.\n\nCHEOPS is the first mission dedicated to studying bright, nearby stars that already are known to host  exoplanets in order to make high-precision observations of the planet's size as it passes in front of its host star. The spacecraft will focus on planets in the super-Earth to Neptune size range, with its data enabling the bulk density of the planets to be derived â€“ a first characterization step towards understanding these alien worlds.\n\nFlight also includes 3 auxiliary payloads: OPS-SAT, EyeSat, ANGELS.\n\nOPS-SAT is the worldâ€™s first free-for-use, in-orbit test bed for new software, applications and techniques in satellite control. It enables new software to be tested in orbit. In the first year of operation, OPS-SAT will host over 100 in-flight experiments submitted from many ESA Member States.\n\nEyeSat is a 3U CubeSat designed to study the zodiacal light and image the Milky Way. It's fitted with an instrument called IRIS, which is a small space telescope.\n\nANGELS is a 12U CubeSat, and is the French industryâ€™s first nanosatellite. The satellite will be fitted with a miniaturized ARGOS NÃ©o instrument, which is 10-times smaller than the equivalent previous-generation device. The instrument collects and determines the position of low-power signals and messages sent by the 20,000 ARGOS beacons now in service worldwide.","type":"Dedicated Rideshare"},"pad":{"id":81,"name":"Soyuz Launch Complex","location":{"id":13,"name":{"id":13,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/13/?format=json","name":"Kourou, French Guiana","country_code":"GUF","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_13_20200803142412.jpg","total_launch_count":314,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_81_20200803143601.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":0,"title":"ESA Web TV","description":"Experts from a variety of space activities talk about their respective fields and why they are important.

Eutelsat 5 West B will provide business continuity and improved quality for these services via a Ku-band payload. The satellite is built on Orbital ATKs GEOStar-2e bus and carries 35 equivalent 36 MHz Ku-band transponders connected to three service areas. Switchable transponders will also increase commercial flexibility.\n\nCo-passenger on this flight will be provided Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. MEV-1 (Mission Extension Vehicle-1) incorporates flight-proven technologies the company has used in its commercial satellite and space logistics businesses. After successfully completing a series of in-orbit tests, the MEV-1 will begin its mission extension service for Intelsat-901 satellite in the graveyard orbit. MEV-1 will relocate the satellite scheduled for the mission extension service, which is planned for a five-year period, after which Intelsat 901 will be place back into graveyard orbit. Intelsat will also have the option to service multiple satellites using the same MEV.\n\nMEV-1 is based on the companyâ€™s GEOStar-3 spacecraft bus platform. Controlled by the companyâ€™s satellite operations team, the MEV-1 uses a reliable, low-risk docking system that attaches to existing features on a customerâ€™s satellite.

Six-wheeled rover weighs around 20 kg and will operate on solar power. It will move around the landing site, performing lunar surface chemical analysis and relaying data back to Earth through the orbiter. The lander will be collecting data on Moon-quakes, thermal properties of the lunar surface, the density and variation of lunar surface plasma. The orbiter will be mapping lunar surface.

This improved two-satellite constellation will enable Eutelsat to optimise resources across both satellites, with enhanced coverage flexibility and connectivity set to take the 7Â° East neighbourhood to a new level. By almost doubling capacity over Sub-Saharan Africa, from 22 to 42 transponders, it will also make room for several hundred additional digital channels to support the regionâ€™s fast expanding TV market.

The images and derived information are required to be provided to Canadian government users at frequent area coverage rates. Contrary to the earlier RadarSat missions, the imagery will not be available commercially.\n\nThe spacecraft Payload will consist of a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor integrated with an Automated Identification System (AIS).
